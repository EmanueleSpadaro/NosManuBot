# NosManuBot
A simple background pixel-bot that abuses of static color patterns inside of NosTale's Fishpond Minigame and automates it.
It allows you to choose which NosTale Window you want to attach to and how many level 5 rewards you want to withdraw.
Performance drawbacks are directly attributable to low-spec hardware, considering NosTale itself is mostly CPU-bound and this bot lacks of GPU-acceleration features.
This bot completely works in background and emulates user keypresses by sending proper signals to the game window using Win32 APIs.
